# task5-titanic-python-analysis
The dataset used is titanic. The analysis and visualization has been done using python.
<BR>
I have only used the train table from the dataset.
<br>
Firstly, I opened a new Jupyter notebook. I cleaned my dataset, dealt with missing values, etc. then I started with analysis and graphical visualization, all using Python.
